# PROGRAMMING EXAMPLE: TEXT PROCESSING
(Line and letter count) Let us now write a program that reads a given text, outputs the text as is, and also prints the number of lines and the number of times each letter appears in the text. An uppercase letter and a lowercase letter are treated as being the same; that is, they are tallied together.
	Since there are 26 letters, we will use an array of 26 components to do the letter count. We also need a variable to store the line count.
	The text is stored in a file, say textin.txt (and is on floppy drive, say a). The output will be stored in a file, say textout.out.

Input: A file containing the text to be processed.
Output: A file containing the text, number of lines, and the number of times a letter appears in the text.
