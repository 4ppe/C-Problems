## Example 1-2
Design an algorithm that calculates the monthly paycheck of a sales-person at a local department store.\
Every salesperson has a base salary. The salesperson also receives a bonus at the end of each month based on the following criteria:\
 If the salesperson has been with the store for five or less years, the bonus is $10 for each year that he or she has worked there. If the salesperson has been with the store for more than five years, the bonus is $20 for each year that he or she has worked there.\
  The salesperson can earn an additional bonus as follows:\
   If the total sale made by the salesperson for the month is more than $5000 but less than $10000, he or she receives a 3% commission on the sale. If the total sale made by the salesperson for the month is at least $10000, he or she receives a 6% commission on the sale.
