# PROGRAMMING EXAMPLE: FIBONACCI NUMBER
* Consider the following sequence of numbers,

	1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 19, 30, ....

* Given the first two numbers of the sequence say a1 and a2, the nth number an , n >= 3, of this sequence is given by 

	an = an-1 + an-2.

	Thus 

	a3 = a2 + a1 = 1 + 1 = 2; 

 	a4 = a3  + a2 = 1 + 2  = 3, 

* Such a sequence is called a Fibonacci sequence. In the above sequence  a2  = 1 and  a1 = 1. However, given any first two numbers, we can determined the nth number, an, n >= 3, of the sequence. The number determined this way is called  the nth Fibonacci number. 

 Suppose a2  = 6 and  a1 = 3. Then  

a3 = a2 +a1 = 6 + 3 = 9; a4 = a3  + a2 = 9 + 6 = 15

	
Input: The first two Fibonacci numbers and the desired Fibonacci number. 

Output: The nth Fibonacci number.
