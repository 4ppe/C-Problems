# PROGRAMMING EXAMPLE: CABLE COMPANY
* In that program, all of the programming instructions are packed in the function main. 
* We rewrite the same program using user-defined functions, further illustrating structured programming. 
* The problem analysis phase shows how to divide a complex problem into smaller subproblems. 
* It also shows that while solving a particular subproblem, you can focus only on that part of the problem.  

* Input to and output of the program are the same as before.


# Problem Analysis and Algorithm Design

*Since there are two types of customers, residential and business, the program contains two separate functions: one to calculate the bill for residential customers and one to calculate the bill for business customers. 
* Both functions calculate the billing amount and then return the billing amount to the function main. 
* The function main prints the amount due. 
* Call the function that calculates the residential bill residential and the function that calculates the business bill business. 
* The formulas to calculate the bills are the same as before. 
* As in Chapter 4, data such as the residential bill processing fee, the cost of residential basic service connection, and so on are special. These are declared as named constants.
