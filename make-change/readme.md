# PROGRAMMING EXAMPLE: MAKE CHANGE
Write a program that takes as an input any change expressed in cents. It then computes the number of half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies to be returned, if you are to return as many half-dollars as possible, then quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies in that order.

	For example 483 cents should be returned as 9 half-dollars, 1 quarter, 1 nickel, and 3 pennies.

Input: Change in cents.

Output: Equivalent change in half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.
