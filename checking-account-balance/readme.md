# PROGRAMMING EXAMPLE: CHECKING ACCOUNT BALANCE

W 250.00
D 1200
W 75.00
I 120.74

* The first line of data shows the account number followed by the account balance at the beginning of the month. 
* Thereafter each line has two entries: the transaction code and the transaction amount. 
* The transaction code W or w means withdrawal, D or d means deposit, and I or i means interest paid by the bank. 
* The program updates the balance after each transaction.
